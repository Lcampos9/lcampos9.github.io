        <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p>Our intended audience is for everyone who wants to consult the weather in their respective location.</p>
            <h3>Age Group</h3>
                <p>It can basically be any person with any age. Weather consultation is not limited to a certain age group. I would say young people search more for weather information.</p>

                <p>Not required</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>Any person with the ability to read and that can use a PC or smartphone.</p>
